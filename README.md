*** lua_toy_compiler ***

This is the result of some studies on the Lua 5.1 binary file format as well as its virtual machine's opcodes (as of verssion 5.1).

It consists of a lua binary (luac) file disassembler as well as a partial compiler implementation, both written in erlang using leex and yecc.

Some additional information, including references, is available in the manual and slides (pdf files). Sorry, portuguese only.
